<h2>The Attendee Experience</h2>
	<p>As Conference Manager at AMS, my primary concern was the attendee experience, and one of the ways I measured and calculated that was though attendee feedback following the conference. See elements of the report that I submitted to senior staff at the organization this past spring.</p>

<h2>Good Buys</h2>
	<p>My first time solving a problem through User Experience Design was at General Assembly. As part of my part time class I moved through the process on a mobile app I created called Good Buys, designed as a solution to “how can we make conscious consumerism easier for consumers.”</p>

<h2>Making the Sausage</h2>
	<p>I approached my portfolio as any designer should: with a user centered approach. See how I built this portfolio with both my, and my user’s, goals in mind.</p>
